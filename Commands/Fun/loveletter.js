    "Every time we talk, I discover something new about you that makes me fall a little deeper. The way you care about the people around you, the way your eyes sparkle when you talk about your passions, the way you make even the most ordinary moments feel extraordinary — it all makes my heart race.",
    "I love the way you see the world — with so much hope, kindness, and beauty. You don't realize how rare you are. In a world full of people trying to be something they're not, you're unapologetically yourself, and that's the most attractive thing about you.",
